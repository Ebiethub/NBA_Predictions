# NBA Playoff Prediction for the 2022-2023 Season

This project aims to predict NBA teams that would qualify for the 2022-2023 playoffs from both the East and West conferences and simulate playoff outcomes for a fictional team of randomly selected players.

# Project Structure

- **Trained Model**: Pre-trained model files for playoff predictions.
- **Results**: Folder containing inference results for team playoff qualification.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.

# Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- streamlit

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt




## Data Source

    The data used in this project includes:
  - Team Data: Contains team-level statistics for the 2022-2023 NBA season.
  - Player Data: Contains individual player statistics for the 2022-2023 NBA season.

## How to Run

1. **Run the streamlit app**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Ensure all data files are placed in the correct location (`players_advance_stats.csv`, `teams_advance_stats.csv`, `teams_traditional_stats.csv`).
   - Launch the streamlit app using the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Prediction**:
   - The app will allow you to select a team from the 2022-2023 NBA season and predict its playoff qualification.

3. **Fictional Team Simulation**:
   - A fictional team of 15 randomly selected players is evaluated for playoff chances based on their aggregated stats.

## Files Included

- `main.py`: Main script for loading data, training models, and predicting playoff teams.
- `teams_advance_stats.csv` and `teams_traditional_stats.csv`: Team statistics for the 2022-2023 NBA season.
- `players_advance_stats.csv`: Player statistics for the 2022-2023 NBA season.
- `Trained Model`: Directory containing trained models for inference.
- `Results`: Directory containing prediction results for each team.

## Model Explanation

- **Model**: XGBoostClassifier and RandomForestClassifier were chosen due to their ability to handle structured data efficiently and perform well on classification tasks.
- **Features**: Important features are selected and used for the prediction.
- **Playoff Prediction**: The model classifies teams with a win percentage above 50% as likely to qualify for the playoffs.

## Fictional Team Assumptions

- The fictional team is formed by randomly selecting 15 players from the 2022-2023 season player pool.
- The teamâ€™s playoff chances are evaluated based on the average stats of the selected players.

This solution addresses all aspects of the test problem, from data preprocessing to model training, deployment, and submission. The Streamlit app adds interactivity to visualize the playoff predictions.
